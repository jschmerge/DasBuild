# DasBuild
*A generic Build System Driven by GNU Make*

## Introduction

A little over a year ago I started getting really sick of duplicating the
same boiler-plate structure for every project Makefile that I was working on.

Around that time I also started running into issues with dropping library code
into another project and having to twiddle the build systems of each for
the project to build properly.

Prompted by the desire to quickly develop C/C++ code without the grief of
stopping every few hours to add extra stuff into a Makefile, I decided to solve
the problem for myself.

What you see here is the second attempt at these goals.
